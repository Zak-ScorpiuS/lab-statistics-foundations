### Challenge 3
Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The score of player A.
* B. The greatest score.
* C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  
"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".
* D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  
"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.". 

Describe the following events:
* Case A: The score of player A is 2.
* Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
* Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe: 
  * Player A wins at least 4 coins.
  * Player A loses more than 2 coins.
  * Player A neither wins nor loses coins.
